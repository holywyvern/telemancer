w-gaming Jam 2019

## Engine

Made with [love](https://love2d.org/)

## Playing and building

To build de game, with all contents inside the "game" folder, just grab all files and put them inside a zip file, then rename the file game.love

Love recognizes .love files and plays them fine.

You can just do `love path/where/game/is` to run it locally for fast development.

## Executable distributions

You can append the .love file to the love executable, because zip headers are at the end, and binary files have a header at the top, it works like a charm!
